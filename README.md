# Red-wine-quality-predictor
This model is trained to predict the quality of red wine. While doing EDA I came to conclusion that it would be better to predict the label as good(1) or bad(0) wine then predicting the exact score of the wine. After preparing the data and oversampling it using SMOTE to make it a balanced dataset, I trained it on various models and found that XGBoost classifier is performing the best with score of 94.1%. so I further check its reliability since its a classifier model only score can not justify its reliability, I then calculate precision, recall and F1 score of the model and found that it perform well there, so finally I checked the model's score on test set and got 92.3%. Then finally, I deployed this model in Heroku app. https://red-wine-quality-checker.herokuapp.com/
